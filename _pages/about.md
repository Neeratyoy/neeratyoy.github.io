Hi there! My name is Neeratyoy Mallik.

I am a PhD student at **AutoML Freiburg** where I work on efficient methods for Hyperparameter Optimization and Neural Architecture Search for Deep Learning. I have also contributed to OpenML-Python, a Python interface to OpenML.

In my free time, I enjoy sketching and painting, playing the harmonica, table tennis and watching movies and anime.

Thank you for visiting my website and taking the time to learn more about me. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mallik[at]cs[dot]uni[hyphen]freiburg[dot]de).
